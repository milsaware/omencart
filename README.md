# âš¡ OmenCart  
**A modern evolution of OpenCart, rebuilt for performance, security, and reliability.**

OmenCart is a free, open-source PHP-based e-commerce solution for online merchants and an independent fork of OpenCart, designed and developed by someone who's lived on *both sides* of eCommerce â€” as a retailer and as a developer. It addresses years of community complaints, code neglect, and architectural flaws in the original platform.

## ðŸš« No more:
- Broken installs out of the box  
- Security risks from exposed system files  
- Outdated coding standards  
- Bloated markup and inconsistent logic  
- Ignored user and contributor feedback  

---

## âœ… Instead, expect:
- **Secure file structure** â€” Public and system files fully separated  
- **Modern JavaScript & PHP standards** â€” No more `var`, no more nonsense  
- **Smarter updates** â€” Auto-backups, rollback support, crash-prevention  
- **Space and speed optimisations** â€” Tabs over spaces, streamlined functions  
- **Real-world usability** â€” Built with both devs and merchants in mind

## Why OmenCart?

Because OpenCart became a last resort for many. And thatâ€™s not good enough anymore.

OmenCart is about fixing whatâ€™s broken *and* pushing forward.  
Itâ€™s not just a prettier skin or an extra module â€” itâ€™s a new foundation.  
Still familiar, but cleaner, leaner, and actually reliable.
