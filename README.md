# ⚡ OmenCart  
**A modern evolution of OpenCart, rebuilt for performance, security, and reliability.**

---
## 🚧 OmenCart - Under Development 🚧

OmenCart is currently in the development phase and is **not** yet ready for production use. The platform is still being refined, and some features are still under development. 

## 🚧 Omencart Progress Update – 24 April 2025
Here’s where we’re at so far:

✅ System and public files separated

🔁 Repeat code removed or refactored

🧼 jQuery stripped out in favour of Vanilla JS

🗃️ Dropped legacy image tables – reworked image handling with cache-busting techniques

🧹 Cleaned up and fixed broken features

📦 Reduced total codebase size by 47MB (without sacrificing functionality)

Still working through the rest of the admin panel – then moving on to the public-facing front end.

The goal is a lean, modern, extension-friendly version of OpenCart that feels clean under the hood but familiar to devs.

### 📢 Stay Updated
To stay updated with the latest changes, releases, and announcements, please follow the repository and turn on notifications for updates.

### What’s Being Worked On:
- **System Files Reorganisation**: Restructuring the codebase for better scalability and performance.
- **Installation Process**: Refining the installation procedure for smoother user experience.
- **Bug Fixes & Optimisations**: Addressing any issues that arise as the platform evolves.

### 🚨 Current Limitations 🚨
- Not all features are implemented.
- Some features are subject to change or removal in future versions.
- Documentation is still being worked on and may not be complete.

### 🛠️ Installation (WIP)
The installation process is currently being updated. Please check back soon for a complete guide on setting up OmenCart locally or on your server.

### 📦 Future Releases
The following features are planned for future releases:
- **Beta Release**: Expected soon.
- **Stable Version**: After thorough testing, the stable release will follow.
- **Patches and Updates**: Once the stable release is live, the platform will be actively maintained, and patches will be rolled out as needed.

### 🧑‍💻 Contributions
OmenCart is open-source! If you find a bug or have an improvement in mind, feel free to leave a comment in the issue section. **Please do not fork the repository at the moment**, as major changes to the file system are taking place, and the current system setup will be rendered obsolete in upcoming commits.

Your feedback is valuable, and contributions will be welcome once the project stabilises and the core structure is finalised.

Thank you for your interest in OmenCart! 🚀

OmenCart is a free, open-source PHP-based e-commerce solution for online merchants and an independent fork of OpenCart, designed and developed by someone who's lived on *both sides* of eCommerce — as a retailer and as a developer. It addresses years of community complaints, code neglect, and architectural flaws in the original platform.

---

## 🚫 No more:
- Broken installs out of the box  
- Security risks from exposed system files  
- Outdated coding standards  
- Bloated markup and inconsistent logic  
- Ignored user and contributor feedback  

---

## ✅ Instead, expect:
- **Secure file structure** — Public and system files fully separated  
- **Modern JavaScript & PHP standards** — No more `var`, no more nonsense  
- **Smarter updates** — Auto-backups, rollback support, crash-prevention  
- **Space and speed optimisations** — Tabs over spaces, streamlined functions  
- **Real-world usability** — Built with both devs and merchants in mind  

---

## Why OmenCart?

Because OpenCart became a last resort for many. And that’s not good enough anymore.

OmenCart is about fixing what’s broken *and* pushing forward.  
It’s not just a prettier skin or an extra module — it’s a new foundation.  
Still familiar, but cleaner, leaner, and actually reliable.
