It’s been a month since I began the process of forking OpenCart and building what I’ve called **OmenCart** — a leaner, modernised, developer & client-friendly version that remains fully compatible with existing OpenCart extensions and themes.

---

## ✅ What’s Been Done

- 🔻 **Codebase reduced** by over 58%
- 🧹 Stripped outdated functions, legacy clutter, and thousands of lines of unnecessary comments
- 🗂️ Reorganised core admin structure for better maintainability
- ⚡ **Introduced AJAX navigation** — no more full-page reloads
- 🚫 Removed dozens of hardcoded UI quirks that made extension development painful
- 🛒 **Revamped product listing** — removed unnecessary logic, simplified data flow, and cut the bloat to make product management faster and cleaner
- 🔧 **Fixed the filters** — streamlined form filtering for quicker, more reliable results
- ⌨️ **Added keyboard hotkey shortcuts** — navigate the admin panel faster with keyboard shortcuts
- 🚫 **Removed `user_token` necessity** from the URL — cleaner and more secure URL structure

---

## 💡 Key Goals (Already Underway)

- 🧩 **Full theme and extension compatibility** – you won’t have to rewrite your code
- 🔄 **Faster UI experience** – seamless page loads using AJAX
- 🧼 A codebase you can actually read, navigate, and contribute to

---

## 🔒 Why It's Not Public Yet

I'm holding back the repo for now to:
- Protect the work from being poached or absorbed into OpenCart prematurely
- Finalise a stable developer preview worth your time
- Ensure that what’s released isn’t just “different” — it’s **better**

---

## 🧪 What’s Next

- Finish rebuilding the admin panel (currently ~50% complete)
- Begin catalog module cleanup
- Add fallback layers for older OpenCart extensions
- Final prep for **developer preview**

## 👀 Stay in the Loop

I’ll post regular updates here as things move forward.  
If you're an extension or theme dev and want early access, testing roles, or to be part of this from the ground up — reach out.

  ## 🚧 Omencart Progress Update – 24 April 2025
Here’s where we’re at so far:

✅ System and public files separated

🔁 Repeat code removed or refactored

🧼 jQuery stripped out in favour of Vanilla JS

🗃️ Dropped legacy image tables – reworked image handling with cache-busting techniques

🧹 Cleaned up and fixed broken features

📦 Reduced total codebase size by 47MB (without sacrificing functionality)

Still working through the rest of the admin panel – then moving on to the public-facing front end.

The goal is a lean, modern, extension-friendly version of OpenCart that feels clean under the hood but familiar to devs.

### 📢 Stay Updated
To stay updated with the latest changes, releases, and announcements, please follow the repository and turn on notifications for updates.

### What’s Being Worked On:
- **System Files Reorganisation**: Restructuring the codebase for better scalability and performance.
- **Installation Process**: Refining the installation procedure for smoother user experience.
- **Bug Fixes & Optimisations**: Addressing any issues that arise as the platform evolves.

### 🚨 Current Limitations 🚨
- Not all features are implemented.
- Some features are subject to change or removal in future versions.
- Documentation is still being worked on and may not be complete.

### 🛠️ Installation (WIP)
The installation process is currently being updated. Please check back soon for a complete guide on setting up OmenCart locally or on your server.

### 📦 Future Releases
The following features are planned for future releases:
- **Beta Release**: Expected soon.
- **Stable Version**: After thorough testing, the stable release will follow.
- **Patches and Updates**: Once the stable release is live, the platform will be actively maintained, and patches will be rolled out as needed.

### 🧑‍💻 Contributions
OmenCart is open-source! If you find a bug or have an improvement in mind, feel free to leave a comment in the issue section. **Please do not fork the repository at the moment**, as major changes to the file system are taking place, and the current system setup will be rendered obsolete in upcoming commits.

Your feedback is valuable, and contributions will be welcome once the project stabilises and the core structure is finalised.
